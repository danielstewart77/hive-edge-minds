"""The slash menu is published, and cannot be published malformed.

Requirement 1: Telegram's slash menu lists the mind's commands with a
description each, so a command can be tapped rather than remembered.

The menu and the handlers come from one table, so they cannot drift apart and
nothing here asserts that they match. What can still go wrong is a single
malformed entry: `set_my_commands` rejects the whole call over one bad name or
one over-long description, which takes down the menu for *every* command while
the bot carries on running. That failure is invisible from the inside — the
symptom is a phone showing no hints, which is the state before this feature
existed.
