# A picker is single use. The enforcement the operator actually sees is the
# keyboard being removed — a message with no buttons cannot produce a tap at
# all — but that removal is an HTTP call to Telegram, and the whole reason
# this exists is that those calls fail. So the claim is taken *here* first,
# synchronously, before anything is awaited: two taps that arrive before the
# edit lands are ordered by this dict, not by the network.
#
# **It is written to disk**, because the incident it exists to prevent runs
# straight through a restart. Polling goes down, taps queue at Telegram's end,
# and the usual way polling comes back is `skippy.service` restarting —
# whereupon `getUpdates` redelivers every queued tap to a fresh process. With
# the claims in memory only, both taps claim successfully and the second ends
# the conversation the first just created, which is exactly 2026-09-17.
