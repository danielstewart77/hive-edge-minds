"""Naming a conversation by replying, rather than by remembering a syntax.

Tapping a command in Telegram's menu *sends* it — it does not type it into
the composer for you to finish. So a command that needs an argument arrives
bare every time it is tapped, and `/rename` answering "Usage: /rename <name>"
means the menu entry for it is decoration: the only way to actually use it is
to know the syntax and type it out, which is what the menu existed to spare
you.

A bare `/rename` therefore asks. The bot sends a prompt with `ForceReply`,
which opens the keyboard with the composer already aimed at that message, and
the operator types the name straight into it.

**The pending rename is held nowhere.** There is no registry of outstanding
prompts keyed by message id, no expiry, no per-chat state. A reply is
recognised by what it is a reply *to*: the bot's own prompt text, which
arrives on the incoming update inside `reply_to_message`. That is what makes
"the prompt never expires" true rather than true-until-the-service-restarts —
a prompt sent before a `skippy.service` restart is answerable after it,
because nothing about the answer depends on the process that asked.

Everything here is a pure function over message text. Nothing talks to
Telegram, reads the network, or knows a chat exists.
